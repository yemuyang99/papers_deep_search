  <data key="d0">Tabular Transformers for Modeling Multivariate Time Series</data>
  <data key="d1">Tabular datasets are ubiquitous in data science applications. Given their
importance, it seems natural to apply state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms
in order to fully unlock their potential. Here we propose neural network models
that represent tabular time series that can optionally leverage their
hierarchical structure. This results in two architectures for tabular time
series: one for learning representations that is analogous to BERT and can be
pre-trained end-to-end and used in downstream tasks, and one that is akin to
GPT and can be used for generation of realistic synthetic tabular sequences. We
demonstrate our models on two datasets: a synthetic credit card transaction
dataset, where the learned representations are used for fraud detection and
synthetic data generation, and on a real pollution dataset, where the learned
encodings are used to predict atmospheric pollutant concentrations. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/IBM/TabFormer.</data>

  <data key="d0">Synthetic Data Generation for Fraud Detection using GANs</data>
  <data key="d1">Detecting money laundering in gambling is becoming increasingly challenging
for the gambling industry as consumers migrate to online channels. Whilst
increasingly stringent regulations have been applied over the years to prevent
money laundering in gambling, despite this, online gambling is still a channel
for criminals to spend proceeds from crime. Complementing online gambling's
growth more concerns are raised to its effects compared with gambling in
traditional, physical formats, as it might introduce higher levels of problem
gambling or fraudulent behaviour due to its nature of immediate interaction
with online gambling experience. However, in most cases the main issue when
organisations try to tackle those areas is the absence of high quality data.
Since fraud detection related issues face the significant problem of the class
imbalance, in this paper we propose a novel system based on Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating synthetic data in order to train a
supervised classifier. Our framework Synthetic Data Generation GAN (SDG-GAN),
manages to outperformed density based over-sampling methods and improve the
classification performance of benchmarks datasets and the real world gambling
fraud dataset.</data>

  <data key="d1">Exploring generative model training for synthetic tabular data, specifically
in sequential contexts such as credit card transaction data, presents
significant challenges. This paper addresses these challenges, focusing on
attaining both high fidelity to actual data and optimal utility for machine

  <data key="d0">Auditing and Generating Synthetic Data with Controllable Trust  Trade-offs</data>
  <data key="d1">Real-world data often exhibits bias, imbalance, and privacy risks. Synthetic
datasets have emerged to address these issues. This paradigm relies on
generative AI models to generate unbiased, privacy-preserving data while
maintaining fidelity to the original data. However, assessing the
trustworthiness of synthetic datasets and models is a critical challenge. We
introduce a holistic auditing framework that comprehensively evaluates
synthetic datasets and AI models. It focuses on preventing bias and
discrimination, ensures fidelity to the source data, assesses utility,
robustness, and privacy preservation. We demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness by auditing various generative models across diverse use cases
like education, healthcare, banking, and human resources, spanning different
data modalities such as tabular, time-series, vision, and natural language.
This holistic assessment is essential for compliance with regulatory
safeguards. We introduce a trustworthiness index to rank synthetic datasets
based on their safeguards trade-offs. Furthermore, we present a
trustworthiness-driven model selection and cross-validation process during
training, exemplified with "TrustFormers" across various data types. This
approach allows for controllable trustworthiness trade-offs in synthetic data
creation. Our auditing framework fosters collaboration among stakeholders,
including data scientists, governance experts, internal reviewers, external
certifiers, and regulators. This transparent reporting should become a standard
practice to prevent bias, discrimination, and privacy violations, ensuring
compliance with policies and providing accountability, safety, and performance
guarantees.</data>

  <data key="d0">Synthesizing Credit Card Transactions</data>
  <data key="d1">Two elements have been essential to AI's recent boom: (1) deep neural nets
and the theory and practice behind them; and (2) cloud computing with its
abundant labeled data and large computing resources.
  Abundant labeled data is available for key domains such as images, speech,
natural language processing, and recommendation engines. However, there are
many other domains where such data is not available, or access to it is highly
restricted for privacy reasons, as with health and financial data. Even when
abundant data is available, it is often not labeled. Doing such labeling is
labor-intensive and non-scalable.
  As a result, to the best of our knowledge, key domains still lack labeled
data or have at most toy data; or the synthetic data must have access to real
data from which it can mimic new data. This paper outlines work to generate
realistic synthetic data for an important domain: credit card transactions.
  Some challenges: there are many patterns and correlations in real purchases.
There are millions of merchants and innumerable locations. Those merchants
offer a wide variety of goods. Who shops where and when? How much do people
pay? What is a realistic fraudulent transaction?
  We use a mixture of technical approaches and domain knowledge including
mechanics of credit card processing, a broad set of consumer domains:
electronics, clothing, hair styling, etc. Connecting everything is a virtual
world. This paper outlines some of our key techniques and provides evidence
that the data generated is indeed realistic.
  Beyond the scope of this paper: (1) use of our data to develop and train
models to predict fraud; (2) coupling models and the synthetic dataset to
assess performance in designing accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs.</data>

  <data key="d1">The generation of synthetic financial data is a critical technology in the
financial domain, addressing challenges posed by limited data availability.
Traditionally, statistical models have been employed to generate synthetic
data. However, these models fail to capture the stylized facts commonly
observed in financial data, limiting their practical applicability. Recently,
machine learning models have been introduced to address the limitations of
statistical models; however, controlling synthetic data generation remains
challenging. We propose CoFinDiff (Controllable Financial Diffusion model), a
synthetic financial data generation model based on conditional diffusion models
that accept conditions about the synthetic time series. By incorporating
conditions derived from price data into the conditional diffusion model via
cross-attention, CoFinDiff learns the relationships between the conditions and
the data, generating synthetic data that align with arbitrary conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that: (i) synthetic data generated by
CoFinDiff capture stylized facts; (ii) the generated data accurately meet
specified conditions for trends and volatility; (iii) the diversity of the
generated data surpasses that of the baseline models; and (iv) models trained
on CoFinDiff-generated data achieve improved performance in deep hedging task.</data>

 Given the critical role of data availability for growth and innovation in financial services, especially small and mid-sized banks lack the data volumes required to fully leverage AI advancements for enhancing fraud detection, operational efficiency, and risk management. With existing solutions facing challenges in scalability, inconsistent standards, and complex privacy regulations, we introduce a synthetic data sharing ecosystem (SynDEc) using generative AI. Employing design science research in collaboration with two banks, among them UnionBank of the Philippines, we developed and validated a synthetic data sharing ecosystem for financial institutions. The derived design principles highlight synthetic data setup, training configurations, and incentivization. Furthermore, our findings show that smaller banks benefit most from SynDEcs and our solution is viable even with limited participation. Thus, we advance data ecosystem design knowledge, show its viability for financial services, and offer practical guidance for privacy-resilient synthetic data sharing, laying groundwork for future applications of SynDEcs.</data>

  <data key="d1">In the rapidly evolving financial industry, the adoption of synthetic tabular data is on the rise to augment scarce data and facilitate data sharing. Existing synthetic tabular data generation methods often overlook a crucial aspect of financial datasets: the presence of a special column representing entities, such as companies or individuals. Treating this column as a mere categorical feature has significant drawbacks, including limiting the model to the original dataset’s entities, increasing privacy risks, and lacking efficient methods for generating data conditioned on specific entities. We introduce EntTabDiff, a diffusion model-based method that addresses these challenges by synthesizing tabular data conditioned on entities. EntTabDiff comprises two components: one that learns the distribution of entities to generate synthetic ones, and another that synthesizes tabular data based on these entities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EntTabDiff using three financial datasets. Experimental results show that EntTabDiff synthesizes data with high utility and improved fidelity.</data>

In finance however, practical applications often require out-of-sample time-series data, simulated under specific conditions. We thus implement our five-network architecture and loss functions with allowance for conditional information, in order to generate out-of-sample multivariate time-series data. Evaluations conducted on the generated data illustrates the high quality of CTS-GAN’s outputs, and a potential application in risk management for stock-only portfolios is demonstrated.</data>

essential for evaluating financial products and investment strategies.
Traditional back-testing methods have mainly relied on historical data-driven
approaches or mathematical model-driven approaches, such as various stochastic
processes. However, in the current era of AI, data-driven approaches, where
models learn the intrinsic characteristics of data directly, have emerged as
promising techniques. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have surfaced as

present significant challenges for deep neural networks to learn their
intrinsic characteristics. This study examines the ability of GANs to learn
diverse and complex temporal patterns (i.e., stylized facts) of both univariate

GANs can capture various stylized facts of financial time series, but their
performance varies significantly depending on the choice of generator

Without assuming the specific process as the underlying asset price process, we can generate synthetic data without predetermined assumptions of the underlying movements of stock prices by trained generative diffusion models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully replicates well-known asset price processes. With various simulation paths, we can also accurately estimate option pricing on the S &amp;P 500.

  <data key="d1">Financial market simulation (FMS) serves as a promising tool for
understanding market anomalies and the underlying trading behaviors. To ensure
high-fidelity simulations, it is crucial to calibrate the FMS model for
generating data closely resembling the observed market data. Previous efforts
primarily focused on calibrating the mid-price data, leading to essential
information loss of the market activities and thus biasing the calibrated
model. The Limit Order Book (LOB) data is the fundamental data fully capturing
the market micro-structure and is adopted by worldwide exchanges. However, LOB
is not applicable to existing calibration objective functions due to its
tabular structure not suitable for the vectorized input requirement. This paper
proposes to explicitly learn the vectorized representations of LOB with a
Transformer-based autoencoder. Then the latent vector, which captures the major
information of LOB, can be applied for calibration. Extensive experiments show
that the learned latent representation not only preserves the non-linear

  <data key="d1">Randomised signature has been proposed as a flexible and easily implementable
alternative to the well-established path signature. In this article, we employ
randomised signature to introduce a generative model for financial time series
data in the spirit of reservoir computing. Specifically, we propose a novel
Wasserstein-type distance based on discrete-time randomised signatures. This
metric on the space of probability measures captures the distance between
(conditional) distributions. Its use is justified by our novel universal
approximation results for randomised signatures on the space of continuous
functions taking the underlying path as an input. We then use our metric as the
loss function in a non-adversarial generator model for synthetic time series
data based on a reservoir neural stochastic differential equation. We compare

  <data key="d0">Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthetic Data Generation in Finance: Evaluating Statistical Similarities and Quality Assessment</data>
  <data key="d1">Generating synthetic data is a complex task that necessitates accurately replicating the statistical and mathematical properties of the original data elements. In sectors such as finance, utilizing and disseminating real data for research or model development can pose substantial privacy risks owing to the inclusion of sensitive information. Additionally, authentic data may be scarce, particularly in specialized domains where acquiring ample, varied, and high-quality data is difficult or costly. This scarcity or limited data availability can limit the training and testing of machine-learning models. In this paper, we address this challenge. In particular, our task is to synthesize a dataset with similar properties to an input dataset about the stock market. The input dataset is anonymized and consists of very few columns and rows, contains many inconsistencies, such as missing rows and duplicates, and its values are not normalized, scaled, or balanced. We explore the utilization of generative adversarial networks, a deep-learning technique, to generate synthetic data and evaluate its quality compared to the input stock dataset. Our innovation involves generating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties of the input elements without revealing complete information. For example, synthetic datasets can capture the distribution of stock prices, trading volumes, and market trends observed in the original dataset. The generated datasets cover a wider range of scenarios and variations, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore different market conditions and investment strategies. This diversity can enhance the robustness and generalization of machine-learning models. We evaluate our synthetic data in terms of the mean, similarities, and correlations.</data>

  <data key="d1">Synthetic Data is increasingly important in financial applications. In

Data generation methods and the progressively improved protections they offer.
While the six levels were devised in the context of financial applications,
they may also be appropriate for other industries as well. Our paper includes:

  <data key="d1">Large Language models (LLMs) usually rely on extensive training datasets. In
the financial domain, creating numerical reasoning datasets that include a mix
of tables and long text often involves substantial manual annotation expenses.
To address the limited data resources and reduce the annotation cost, we

based on common financial formulas using Large Language Models. First, we
compile a list of common financial formulas and construct a graph based on the
variables these formulas employ. We then augment the formula set by combining
those that share identical variables as new elements. Specifically, we explore
formulas obtained by manual annotation and merge those formulas with shared
variables by traversing the constructed graph. Finally, utilizing GPT-3.5, we
generate financial question-answering data that encompasses both tabular

Our experiments demonstrate that synthetic data generated by FinLLMs
effectively enhances the performance of several large-scale numerical reasoning

multiple entities to collaboratively train a generative model while respecting

  <data key="d1">Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been extremely successful in generating samples, from seemingly high‐dimensional probability measures. However, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint probability distributions induced by time‐series data. Furthermore, long time‐series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space, which may render generative modeling infeasible. To overcome these challenges, motivated by the autoregressive models in econometric, we are interested in the conditional distribution of future time series given the past information. We propose the generic conditional Sig‐WGAN framework by integrating Wasserstein‐GANs (WGANs) with mathematically principled and efficient path feature extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a graded sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a stream of data, and its expected value characterizes the law of the time‐series model. In particular, we develop the conditional Sig‐ W1$W_1$ metric that captures the conditional joint law of time series models and use it as a discriminator. The signature feature space enables the explicit representation of the proposed discriminators, which alleviates the need for expensive training. We validate our method on both synthetic and empirical dataset and observe that our method consistently and significantly outperforms state‐of‐the‐art benchmarks with respect to measures of similarity and predictive ability.</data>

generate scenarios for the calculation of Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected
Shortfall (ES) and predict the movement of the market risk factors. We present

tabular form, are generated and analyzed for insight generation. However, such

offers a solution by providing provable and quantifiable privacy protection.
Consequently, differentially private data synthesis has emerged as a promising
approach to privacy-aware data sharing. This paper provides a comprehensive

highlighting the unique challenges of each generation model for generating
tabular data under differential privacy constraints. We classify the methods
into statistical and deep learning-based approaches based on their generation
models, discussing them in both centralized and distributed environments. We

strengths and weaknesses in terms of utility, privacy, and computational
complexity. Additionally, we present and discuss various evaluation methods for

present in the US National Market System for equities (NMS). Agent-Based models
are a natural choice for understanding financial markets. Financial markets
feature a constrained action space that should simplify model creation, produce
a wealth of data that should aid model validation, and a successful ABFM could
strongly impact system design and policy development processes. Despite these
advantages, ABFMs have largely remained an academic novelty. We hypothesize
that two factors limit the usefulness of ABFMs. First, many ABFMs fail to
capture relevant microstructure mechanisms, leading to differences in the
mechanics of trading. Second, the simple agents that commonly populate ABFMs do
not display the breadth of behaviors observed in human traders or the trading
systems that they create. We investigate these issues through the development
of ABMMS, which features a fragmented market structure, communication
infrastructure with propagation delays, realistic auction mechanisms, and more.
As a baseline, we populate ABMMS with simple trading agents and investigate
properties of the generated data. We then compare the baseline with
experimental conditions that explore the impacts of market topology or

  <data key="d1">This article presents XGB-Chiarella, a powerful new approach for deploying
agent-based models to generate realistic intra-day artificial financial price
data. This approach is based on agent-based models, calibrated by XGBoost
machine learning surrogate. Following the Extended Chiarella model, three types
of trading agents are introduced in this agent-based model: fundamental
traders, momentum traders, and noise traders. In particular, XGB-Chiarella
focuses on configuring the simulation to accurately reflect real market
behaviours. Instead of using the original Expectation-Maximisation algorithm
for parameter estimation, the agent-based Extended Chiarella model is
calibrated using XGBoost machine learning surrogate. It is shown that the
machine learning surrogate learned in the proposed method is an accurate proxy
of the true agent-based market simulation. The proposed calibration method is
superior to the original Expectation-Maximisation parameter estimation in terms
of the distance between historical and simulated stylised facts. With the same
underlying model, the proposed methodology is capable of generating realistic
price time series in various stocks listed at three different exchanges, which
indicates the universality of intra-day price formation process. For the time
scale (minutes) chosen in this paper, one agent per category is shown to be
sufficient to capture the intra-day price formation process. The proposed
XGB-Chiarella approach provides insights that the price formation process is
comprised of the interactions between momentum traders, fundamental traders,

The resulting trade and quote message data from the simulations are then
aggregated, calibrated and visualised. Various stylised facts are presented
along with event visualisations and price impact curves. We argue that
additional realism in modelling can be achieved with a small set of agent
parameters and simple interaction rules once interactions are reactive,
asynchronous and in event time. We argue that the reactive nature of market
agents may be a fundamental property of financial markets and when accounted
for can allow for parsimonious modelling without recourse to additional sources
of noise.</data>

  <data key="d0">Calibrating an adaptive Farmer-Joshi agent-based model for financial  markets</data>
  <data key="d1">We replicate the contested calibration of the Farmer and Joshi agent based
model of financial markets using a genetic algorithm and a Nelder-Mead with
threshold accepting algorithm following Fabretti. The novelty of the
Farmer-Joshi model is that the dynamics are driven by trade entry and exit
thresholds alone. We recover the known claim that some important stylized facts
observed in financial markets cannot be easily found under calibration -- in
particular those relating to the auto-correlations in the absolute values of
the price fluctuations, and sufficient kurtosis. However, rather than concerns
relating to the calibration method, what is novel here is that we extended the
Farmer-Joshi model to include agent adaptation using an Brock and Hommes
approach to strategy fitness based on trading strategy profitability. We call
this an adaptive Farmer-Joshi model: the model allows trading agents to switch
between strategies by favouring strategies that have been more profitable over
some period of time determined by a free-parameter fixing the profit monitoring
time-horizon. In the adaptive model we are able to calibrate and recover
additional stylized facts, despite apparent degeneracy's. This is achieved by
combining the interactions of trade entry levels with trade strategy switching.
We use this to argue that for low-frequency trading across days, as calibrated
to daily sampled data, feed-backs can be accounted for by strategy die-out
based on intermediate term profitability; we find that the average trade
monitoring horizon is approximately two to three months (or 40 to 60 days) of
trading.</data>

  <data key="d0">Loss aversion in an agent-based asset pricing model</data>
  <data key="d1">A well-defined agent-based asset pricing model able to match the widely observed properties of financial time series is valuable for testing the implications of various biases associated with investors' behaviour. Extending one of the most successful models in capturing traders behaviour, we present a new behavioural agent-based asset pricing model. Specifically, we introduce a well-known behavioural bias in the model, loss aversion, and evaluate its implications. First, measuring how close the simulated time series are to its empirical counterparts, we show that the model with loss aversion better matches and explains the properties of real-world financial data, compared with the base model without the behavioural bias. Secondly, we assess the impact of different levels of loss aversion not only on the agents' switching mechanisms, but also on the properties of the time series generated by the model. We demonstrate how for different levels of the loss aversion parameter, the biased agents tend to be driven out of the market at different points in time. Since even the simplest strategies have been shown to survive the competition in an agent-based setting, we can link our findings with the behavioural finance literature, which states that investors' systematic biases lead to unexpected market behaviour, instabilities and systematic errors. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the simulated time series and show the resulting dynamics replicate a rich set of the stylized facts including: absence of autocorrelation, heavy tails, volatility clustering and conditional heavy tails of returns, long memory of absolute returns, as well as volume–volatility relations, gain–loss asymmetry, power-law behaviour and long memory of volume.</data>

  <data key="d0">Agent-based simulation of a financial market</data>
  <data key="d1">This paper introduces an agent-based artificial financial market in which
heterogeneous agents trade one single asset through a realistic trading
mechanism for price formation. Agents are initially endowed with a finite
amount of cash and a given finite portfolio of assets. There is no
money-creation process; the total available cash is conserved in time. In each
period, agents make random buy and sell decisions that are constrained by
available resources, subject to clustering, and dependent on the volatility of
previous periods. The model herein proposed is able to reproduce the
leptokurtic shape of the probability density of log price returns and the
clustering of volatility. Implemented using extreme programming and
object-oriented technology, the simulator is a flexible computational
experimental facility that can find applications in both academic and
industrial research projects.</data>

  <data key="d0">Self-Organized Percolation Model for Stock Market Fluctuations</data>
  <data key="d1">In the Cont-Bouchaud model [cond-mat/9712318] of stock markets, percolation
clusters act as buying or selling investors and their statistics controls that
of the price variations. Rather than fixing the concentration controlling each
cluster connectivity artificially at or close to the critical value, we propose
that clusters shatter and aggregate continuously as the concentration evolves
randomly, reflecting the incessant time evolution of groups of opinions and
market moods. By the mechanism of ``sweeping of an instability'' [D. Sornette,
Journal de Physique I 4, 209 (1994)], this market model spontaneously exhibits
reasonable power law statistics for the distribution of price changes and
accounts for the other important stylized facts of stock market price
fluctuations.</data>

We explore the utilization of generative adversarial networks, a deep-learning technique, to generate synthetic data and evaluate its quality compared to the input stock dataset. Our innovation involves generating artificial datasets that mimic the statistical properties of the input elements without revealing complete information. For example, synthetic datasets can capture the distribution of stock prices, trading volumes, and market trends observed in the original dataset.

Extending one of the most successful models in capturing traders behaviour, we present a new behavioural agent-based asset pricing model. Specifically, we introduce a well-known behavioural bias in the model, loss aversion, and evaluate its implications. First, measuring how close the simulated time series are to its empirical counterparts, we show that the model with loss aversion better matches and explains the properties of real-world financial data, compared with the base model without the behavioural bias. Secondly, we assess the impact of different levels of loss aversion not only on the agents\u0027 switching mechanisms, but also on the properties of the time series generated by the model. We demonstrate how for different levels of the loss aversion parameter, the biased agents tend to be driven out of the market at different points in time. Since even the simplest strategies have been shown to survive the competition in an agent-based setting, we can link our findings with the behavioural finance literature, which states that investors\u0027 systematic biases lead to unexpected market behaviour, instabilities and systematic errors. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the simulated time series and show the resulting dynamics replicate a rich set of the stylized facts including: absence of autocorrelation, heavy tails, volatility clustering and conditional heavy tails of returns, long memory of absolute returns, as well as volume\u2013volatility relations, gain\u2013loss asymmetry, power-law behaviour and long memory of volume.", "color": "#97c2fc", "font": {"size": 8}, "id": "200ac500f7d57704f673ac57bfbe431d55a998a0", "label": "Loss aversion in an\nagent-based asset\npricing model", "sem_id": "200ac500f7d57704f673ac57bfbe431d55a998a0", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "Loss aversion in an agent-based asset pricing model"}, {"abbrv": "A deterministic\nbehaviour for\nrealistic price\ndynamics", "abstract": "", "color": "#97c2fc", "font": {"size": 8}, "id": "d73b8204744a78afc424d180a8067fbbe79761f1", "label": "A deterministic\nbehaviour for\nrealistic price\ndynamics", "sem_id": "d73b8204744a78afc424d180a8067fbbe79761f1", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "title": "A deterministic behaviour for realistic price dynamics"}, {"abbrv": "Synthetic Data\nGeneration for Fraud\nDetection using GANs", "abstract": "Detecting money laundering in gambling is becoming increasingly challenging\nfor the gambling industry as consumers migrate to online channels.
